Allelic recruitment of GABP is consistently observed across four cancer types, highlighting a shared mechanism underlying TERT reactivation.

To elucidate the molecular function of GABP in human haematopoiesis, the present study addressed effects of ectopic overexpression of GABP focussing on the myeloid compartment. Combined overexpression of GABPA and GABPB1 caused a proliferation block in cell lines and drastically reduced the colony-forming capacity of murine lineage-negative cells. Impaired proliferation resulted from perturbed cellular cycling and induction of myeloid differentiation shown by surface markers and myelomonocytic morphology of U937 cells. Depending on the dosage and functional integrity of GABP, ITGAM expression was induced. ITGAM encodes CD11b, the alpha subunit of integrin Mac-1, whose beta subunit, ITGB2/CD18, was already described to be regulated by GABP. Finally, Shield1-dependent proteotuning, luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that GABP activates the ITGAM/CD11b promoter via three binding sites close to the translational start site.

In 90% of malignant tumors this is explained by upregulation of telomerase expression, but the genetic cause was long largely unknown. In 2013 two independent studies discovered high frequencies of mutations in the promoter of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in melanoma (Horn et  al., 2013; Huang et  al., 2013). TERT encodes the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase. The mutations carry a UV-signature with a C>T or CC>TT transition at two dipyrimidine hotspots and generate binding sites for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors, such as GABP (Bell et  al., 2015), which lead to a 2-4 fold increase in TERT activity (Horn et  al., 2013; Huang et  al., 2013). Studies in larger cohorts have found somewhat lower mutation frequencies; 38 % in primary melanomas and 50 % in metastases (Griewank et  al., 2014; Heidenreich et  al., 2014; Nagore et  al., 2016). Interestingly, TERT promoter mutation status has been associated with established prognostic factors in primary melanoma, such as Breslow thickness and ulceration, as well as with BRAF and NRAS mutations (Griewank et  al., 2014; Heidenreich et  al., 2014; Macerola et  al., 2015; Nagore et  al., 2016; Populo et  al., 2014). Furthermore, Griewank et  al. (2014) showed in a study including 362 patients with primary and metastatic melanoma that the presence of TERT promoter mutations in the subgroup of non-acral cutaneous melanoma is independently associated with poor overall survival. Populo et  al. (2014) reported a similar association with poorer survival in a univariate analysis in a cohort of primary melanoma and Nagore et  al. demonstrated that TERT promoter mutations were associated with faster tumor growth in melanoma (Nagore et  al., 2015). More recently, Nagore et  al. (2016) also presented a study of 300 patients with primary melanoma where simultaneous occurrence of TERT promoter mutations and BRAF/NRAS mutations conferred the worst prognosis.

This article provides a comprehensive review of this exciting new thyroid cancer field. The oncogenic role of TERT promoter mutations involves their creation of consensus binding sites for ETS transcriptional factors. TERT C228T is far more common than TERT C250T and their collective prevalence is, on average, 0%, 11.3%, 17.1%, 43.2%, and 40.1% in benign thyroid tumors, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer, poorly differentiated thyroid cancer, and anaplastic thyroid cancer, respectively, displaying an association with aggressive types of thyroid cancer. TERT promoter mutations are associated with aggressive thyroid tumor characteristics, tumor recurrence, and patient mortality as well as BRAF V600E mutation. Coexisting BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations have a robust synergistic impact on the aggressiveness of PTC, including a sharply increased tumor recurrence and patient mortality, while either mutation alone has a modest impact. Thus, TERT with promoter mutations represents a prominent new oncogene in thyroid cancer and the mutations are promising new diagnostic and prognostic genetic markers for thyroid cancer, which, in combination with BRAF V600E mutation or other genetic markers (e.g., RAS mutations), are proving to be clinically useful for the management of thyroid cancer.

In support of these results, we found that peripheral blood levels of CD11b(+)Jag2(+) cells in mouse models of colorectal cancer and in a cohort of untreated patients with colorectal cancer were indicative of metastatic disease. In patients with colorectal cancer, the presence of circulating CD11b(+)Jag2(+) cells was accompanied by loss of E-cadherin in the corresponding patient tumors.

Cultures of human CD34(+) progenitors supplemented with conditioned medium from breast cancer cell lines or PlGF, but not from nontumorigenic breast epithelial lines, generate CD11b(+) cells capable of inducing endothelial cell sprouting in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo.

In a mouse model of breast cancer, circulating CD11b(+) cells were proangiogenic in the sprouting assays. Silencing of PlGF in tumor cells prevented the generation of proangiogenic activity in circulating CD11b(+) cells, inhibited tumor blood flow, and slowed tumor growth.

If you prefer to use local Probase Linking, you can download the original Probase dataset, name it **data-concept-instance-relations.txt**, and put it under this directory.

The dataset can be downloaded from either [Microsoft Research Page](https://concept.research.microsoft.com/Home/Download) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CDprcsydtF6GPREM8_YZ9NMChn4oZKHY/view?usp=sharing)
